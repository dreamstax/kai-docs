## Future ideas
This section is just a list of ideas of things we'd like to support in the future but also haven't been fully thought out
### Support scale to zero
Some workloads especially within the AI space can really take advantage of scale to zero behavior. Drastic reduction in cost and need to support always on resources can quickly get out of hand.
K8S support for scale to zero is pretty lackluster at the moment and the solutions we've looked at typically involve some external proxy for request monitoring and determining initial scale.
We would like to fully investigate this functionality and give proper suppoort to this feature as we believe it could offer good value.
